Reinforcement Learning for Stock Trading

Overview

This project implements a stock trading environment using Reinforcement Learning (RL). The agent is trained using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, optimizing a risk-adjusted reward function based on the Treynor Ratio. The environment supports multi-stock trading, making it more robust for real-world financial applications.

Environment Details

The stock trading environment is built using OpenAI Gym and supports multiple stocks. It models a portfolio where the agent decides to buy, hold, or sell stocks based on market conditions. Key features include:

- State Space: Historical stock prices over volume data, market benchmarks, portfolio holdings, and technical indicators
- Action Space: Continuous control for precise trading (trade execution, stop-loss, and take-profit thresholds)
- Reward Function: Risk-adjusted return using the Treynor Ratio
- Multi-Stock Support: The agent can manage multiple stocks simultaneously

Technical Indicators

The environment incorporates various technical indicators to improve trading decisions:

- SMA: Trend identification (10/30/50 days)
- RSI: Overbought/oversold (14-day)
- MACD: Momentum (12/26/9 EMAs)
- Bollinger Bands: Volatility (20-day SMA +/- 2sigma)
- Stochastic: Price momentum (%K/%D)
- ATR: Volatility measurement (14-day)
- OBV: Volume confirmation (Cumulative)

PPO Algorithm

The agent is trained using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, which is a policy gradient method that balances exploration and exploitation. Key PPO features include:

- Clipped objective function: Prevents overly large policy updates
- Advantage Estimation: Uses Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE)
- Batch updates: Efficient learning using minibatches

Reward Function

The reward function is designed to encourage risk-adjusted returns using the Treynor Ratio:

- Portfolio Returns: Measures changes in portfolio value
- Beta Calculation: Measures the portfolio?s sensitivity to market movements
- Treynor Ratio: (Portfolio Return - Risk-Free Rate) / Beta

A higher Treynor Ratio means the agent achieves higher returns for each unit of market risk, leading to more optimal trading strategies.
